### Description

DISCLAIMER - This app is still in the prototype phase and does not yet include an authentication layer. (31/8/22)

The Garden Database App is a Fullstack PERN (Postgres, Express, React, Node) application that aims to create a visual database for recording information about a users vegetable gardens.

The first of two main features in this app is a Plot Display. This displays a garden plot and all the relevant plants inside the plot. The plot display has a harvest progress status which lets the user how long each plant has till its optimal harvest time.

The second main feature is a Plant Library. This is where the user can add unique plants to a list and all the relevant information about those plants. Adding plants to the library will allow the user to add commonly used plants quickly to their plots.
