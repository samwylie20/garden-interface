# Garden Database App - Frontend

## This is the frontend repo for my Garden Database App

### Description

The Garden Database App aims to create a visual database for recording information about a users vegetable gardens.

The first of two main features in this app is a Plot Display. This displays a garden plot and all the relevant plants inside the plot. The plot display has a harvest progress status which lets the user how long each plant has till its optimal harvest time.

The second main feature is a Plant Library. This is where the user can add unique plants to a list and all the relevant information about those plants. Adding plants to the library will allow the user to add commonly used plants quickly to their plots.
